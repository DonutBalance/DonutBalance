# Donut Balance

A client-side mod for DonutSMP that displays each player's balance above their name tag automatically. No commands needed — just look at a player and their balance shows up.

## Why Use This?

On DonutSMP, checking someone's balance normally means typing a command and reading chat. This mod skips all of that by putting the balance right above their head, making trading and general awareness a lot easier.
