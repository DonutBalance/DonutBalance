# Donut Balance

A client-side mod for DonutSMP that displays each player's balance above their name tag automatically. No commands needed — just look at a player and their balance shows up.

## Why Use This?

On DonutSMP, checking someone's balance normally means typing a command and reading chat. This mod skips all of that by putting the balance right above their head, making trading and general awareness a lot easier.

## Features

- Shows each nearby player's balance above their name tag in real time
- Color-coded so you can tell at a glance how much someone has
- Toggle the display on and off with a keybind (default: B)
- Only shows balances for players within 32 blocks

## Important

This mod only works on DonutSMP. It will load on any server but balance data will not appear anywhere else.

Works on all 1.21+ version if you have any errors or crashes leave a comment with the version and the error log.
